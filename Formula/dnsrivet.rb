  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      DNSRivet is installed but not started because it needs an upstream.
      Start it with, for example:

        sudo dnsrivet start --upstream 'doh3=https://resolver.example/profile'

      After `brew upgrade dnsrivet`, load the upgraded binary with:

        sudo dnsrivet restart

      Before `brew uninstall dnsrivet`, restore system DNS and remove the
      launchd service with:

        sudo dnsrivet uninstall

      The signed PKG and Homebrew formula are alternative installation methods.
